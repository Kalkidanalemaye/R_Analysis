# AutosRUs

AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles. There are a number of issues surrounding the vehicle’s specifications and manufacturing process that are blocking the manufacturing team from proceeding. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to help analyze the production data in order to justify some last-minute design decisions. With Jeremy’s help, the launch of the MechaCar should be one of the most successful product launches in the company’s history.

## Program Used

R is a programming language that has a variety of uses in data science. R has solidified itself in academia and industry as one of the go-to programming languages for statistical modelling and hypothesis testing. In recent years, R developers have extended R’s capabilities to generate machine learning algorithms and other advanced models to ensure that R can be used in every stage of data analytics.

## Datasets for Challenge

1. The results of an mpg testing dataset of 50 potential prototype MechaCars. The MechaCar prototypes were produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle performance. Multiple metrics such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance were collected for each vehicle.

2. MechaCar suspension coil test results from multiple production lots. In this dataset, the weight capacity of multiple suspension coils were tested to determine if the manufacturing process is consistent across lots.
