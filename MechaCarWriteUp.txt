Multiple R-squared:  0.7149,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.6825

                                        Summary

Based on the results the intercept, vehicle length and ground clearance variables have significant effect on mpg(miles per gallon).

The slope of our linear model is not zero because the pearson correlation coefficient which is our r-value is 0.71 indicating that the relationship between our variables is a strong positive correlation. 
In addition to our r-value, the p-value obtained from our analysis is 5.35e-11 which is smaller than the standard significance level of 0.05%. This shows that the result is significant. 

This linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because we have sufficient result to reject our null hypothesis. As states earlier the variables show significant correlation.

                                            Summary

The current manufacturing data meets the design specification for the MechaCar suspension coils which should have a variance less than or equal to 100 pounds per inch.
As we can see in the results above, the variance is 62.3 which is lower than 100 pounds per inch. This result implies that the PSI will range from 0 to 62.3 from the mean value.

t = -2.0916, df = 49, p-value = 0.04168

                                        Summary

The suspension coil’s pound-per-inch results are not statistically different from the mean population results of 1,500 pounds per inch. 
This is due to the results showing the p-value as greater than 0.05% which is our standard significant level. 

Based on further investigation based on the lot numbers, we can see that some suspension coil's pound-per-inch results are statistically different form the mean value.
For instance, lot 3 has a p-value less than 0.05% which indicates significance. 

                                        Design Your Own Study

Think critically about what metrics you would think would be of interest to a consumer (cost, fuel efficiency, color options, etc.).
Determine what question we would ask, what the null and alternative hypothesis would be to answer that question, and what statistical test could be used to test this hypothesis.
Knowing what test should be used, what data should be collected?

I would think that the cost of the vehicle and color options would be of ineterst to customers. 

This study will focus on the following questions:

1. What is the correlation between the cost of the vehicle and customer satisfaction?
2. What is the correlation between the color options and customer satisfaction?

Null hypothesis: The slope of the linear model is equal to zero.
Alternative hypothesis: The slope of the linear model is not equal to zero. 

To test my hypotheses, I will use the r-value also known as the pearson correlation coefficient to determine the correlation.
Determining the correlation will help me answer as to which hypothesis to accept. 

To use this test effectively I will need the following datasets:

1. MechaCar prototype data which includes the cost of the vehicles and the different colors available.
2. Customer satisfaction survey data.
3. Competitor's vehicle data specifically the cost of their vehicles and the color options they offer.
